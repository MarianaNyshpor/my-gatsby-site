The palate isn't overly expressive, offering unripened apple, citrus and dried sage alongside brisk acidity.","title":"Nicosia 2013 Vulkà Bianco (Etna)","points":"87","taster_name":"Kerin O’Keefe","taster_twitter_handle":"@kerinokeefe","designation":"Vulkà Bianco","variety":"White Blend","region_1":"Etna","province":"Sicily & Sardinia","country":"Italy","winery":"Nicosia","price":null},{"id":"3fd18574-40c2-5249-9281-18c02054f586","description":"This is ripe and fruity, a wine that is smooth while still structured. Firm tannins are filled out with juicy red berry fruits and freshened with acidity. It's already drinkable, although it will certainly be better from 2016.","title":"Quinta dos Avidagos 2011 Avidagos Red (Douro)","points":"87","taster_name":"Roger Voss","taster_twitter_handle":"@vossroger","designation":"Avidagos","variety":"Portuguese Red","region_1":null,"province":"Douro","country":"Portugal","winery":"Quinta dos Avidagos","price":15},{"id":"d8668cb4-1b34-5995-8ee4-8eff4c9d0754","description":"Tart and snappy, the flavors of lime flesh and rind dominate. Some green pineapple pokes through, with crisp acidity underscoring the flavors.

The palate is a bit more opulent, with notes of honey-drizzled guava and mango giving way to a slightly astringent, semidry finish.","title":"St. Julian 2013 Reserve Late Harvest Riesling (Lake Michigan Shore)","points":"87","taster_name":"Alexander Peartree","taster_twitter_handle":null,"designation":"Reserve Late Harvest","variety":"Riesling","region_1":"Lake Michigan Shore","province":"Michigan","country":"US","winery":"St. Julian","price":13},{"id":"08132836-cfa9-5b4f-a82f-e88ba090f07c","description":"Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew.","title":"Sweet Cheeks 2012 Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)","points":"87","taster_name":"Paul Gregutt","taster_twitter_handle":"@paulgwine ","designation":"Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block","variety":"Pinot Noir","region_1":"Willamette Valley","province":"Oregon","country":"US","winery":"Sweet Cheeks","price":65},{"id":"784bc899-a64a-5f83-a120-85636c306cc3","description":"Blackberry and raspberry aromas show a typical Navarran whiff of green herbs and, in this case, horseradish. In the mouth, this is fairly full bodied, with tomatoey acidity. Spicy, herbal flavors complement dark plum fruit, while the finish is fresh but grabby.","title":"Tandem 2011 Ars In Vitro Tempranillo-Merlot (Navarra)","points":"87","taster_name":"Michael Schachner","taster_twitter_handle":"@wineschach","designation":"Ars In Vitro","variety":"Tempranillo-Merlot","region_1":"Navarra","province":"Northern Spain","country":"Spain","winery":"Tandem","price":15},{"id":"dfd258c9-927e-528f-9285-8dce30d02305","description":"Here's a bright, informal red that opens with aromas of candied berry, white pepper and savory herb that carry over to the palate. It's balanced with fresh acidity and soft tannins.","title":"Terre di Giurfo 2013 Belsito Frappato (Vittoria)","points":"87","taster_name":"Kerin O’Keefe","taster_twitter_handle":"@kerinokeefe","designation":"Belsito","variety":"Frappato","region_1":"Vittoria","province":"Sicily & Sardinia","country":"Italy","winery":"Terre di Giurfo","price":16},{"id":"d16363c4-aa95-5603-94ff-988c136bee12","description":"This dry and restrained wine offers spice in profusion.
